Once upon a time, people used to save their money in piggy banks or take it to a big building called a bank. The bank would keep their money safe and pay them a little extra for trusting them with their money.
But some people didn't like having to go to the bank all the time, and they didn't like that the bank sometimes took their money and used it for things they didn't agree with.
So, some very smart people came up with a new way to save and use money, without needing a bank. They made something called DeFi, which stands for Decentralized Finance.
In DeFi, instead of using a bank, people can save and use their money on a computer network called the blockchain. It's like a big digital piggy bank that everyone can use and trust. People can use DeFi to borrow and lend money, trade different kinds of money, and earn rewards for helping to keep the network running.
One cool thing about DeFi is that it's open to everyone, not just rich people or big companies. Anyone with a computer and internet connection can use DeFi and be a part of the network.
So now, people don't have to worry about going to the bank or giving their money to someone they don't trust. They can use DeFi to save and use their money in a way that's fair and transparent for everyone.
And that's how DeFi works!
In the world of DeFi, people don't have to worry about banks or other middlemen taking their money or controlling their finances. Instead, they can be in charge of their own money and use it in ways that work best for them.
For example, imagine a farmer who wants to borrow money to buy more seeds for their crops. In traditional finance, the farmer might have to go to a bank and fill out a bunch of paperwork, and then the bank would decide whether or not to lend them the money. But in DeFi, the farmer could use a decentralized lending platform to borrow money directly from other people who are willing to lend it, without any middlemen involved.
Or, imagine a musician who wants to sell their music directly to fans without going through a record label. In traditional finance, the musician might have to give a percentage of their earnings to a record label or other middlemen. But in DeFi, the musician could use a decentralized marketplace to sell their music directly to fans, keeping all the earnings for themselves.
Another cool thing about DeFi is that it's built on blockchain technology, which means that all the transactions and activities on the network are recorded and can't be changed or manipulated. This makes DeFi more transparent and trustworthy than traditional finance, where sometimes banks or other middlemen might hide information or use it for their own benefit.
So that's how DeFi works! It's a way for people to use and control their money without relying on banks or other middlemen, and it's built on a technology that makes it fair and transparent for everyone.


Here, we used a term blockchain. Lets try to understand it.

Have you ever played a game of building blocks, where you stack different shapes and colors on top of each other to make a tower? Well, imagine that the tower you build is like a computer program or a website.
When you build a tower, you want to make sure it's sturdy and won't fall over. You also want to make sure that it looks nice and everyone who sees it likes it. In the same way, when people build computer programs or websites, they want to make sure they work well and look good.
Now, imagine that you're building your tower with your friends, but you're not in the same room. Instead, you're each building your own part of the tower at home, using your own blocks. You can't see what your friends are building, but you want to make sure that your part of the tower fits with theirs and that it's still sturdy and looks good.
To do this, you could use a special tool called a "blockchain." The blockchain is like a big, digital notebook that everyone can write in. Each time you add a block to your tower, you write down what you added in the blockchain notebook. Then, your friends can see what you added and make sure that their part of the tower fits with yours.
The really cool thing about the blockchain is that once something is written down in the notebook, it can't be changed or erased. So, everyone can trust that what's written in the notebook is true and accurate.
In the same way, when people use blockchain technology to build computer programs or websites, they can trust that the information in the blockchain is accurate and can't be changed or manipulated. This makes the blockchain a really powerful tool for building things that are fair, transparent, and trustworthy.
And that's how the blockchain works! It's like a digital notebook that everyone can write in, and it helps people build things that are strong, beautiful, and trustworthy.
